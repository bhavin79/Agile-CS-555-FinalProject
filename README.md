# CS555-FinalProject

This is the final project repository for CS/SSW-555 (Agile Development) for Fall 2023.

### Project brief description:
**SIDEKICK** is an online gaming platform tailored for elderly residents in care facilities, offering a user-friendly virtual experience to make their time more enjoyable and active. It addresses the challenge of providing a stress-free and entertaining pastime for seniors, along with promoting accountability through in-game rewards, such as encouraging timely medication intake. This initiative responds to the pressing need to incorporate technology into end-of-life support, given the challenges hospice facilities face with staff turnover and diminishing personal interactions with patients. SIDEKICK aims to alleviate feelings of loneliness and boredom by offering an innovative, interactive game that not only provides companionship but also entertains. Its accountability system incentivizes engagement in both the game and real life, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of end-of-life experiences for patients.
